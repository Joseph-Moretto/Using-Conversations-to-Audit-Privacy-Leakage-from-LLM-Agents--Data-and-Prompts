# Overview of Safety Prompts
This directory contains a list of safety prompts in a YAML file. The YAML file uses variables to substitute private attributes, refusal methods, and base prompts into the safety prompts. 

The file contains headers that label the type of safety prompt with multiple examples for that type. 

The safety prompts are a mix of modified prompts from the sources and original prompts that were inspired. 
The sources for inspiration are listed at the top of the file and sources for prompts that were modified are linked at the headers.
