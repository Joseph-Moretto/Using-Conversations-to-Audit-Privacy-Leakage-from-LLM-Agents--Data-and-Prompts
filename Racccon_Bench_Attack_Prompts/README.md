# Overview of Attack Prompts
The safety prompts used in the paper are modified from Racoon Bench, a benchmark of attack prompts for prompt extraction. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06737

The prompts were modified to target specific private attributes instead of system prompts. 

These prompts were used to establish a baseline for LLM agent's defenses.
