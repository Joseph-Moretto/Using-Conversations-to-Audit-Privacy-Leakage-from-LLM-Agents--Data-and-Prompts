# Overview
This directory contains the generated user profiles and schedules used as private information in the experiments.

The profiles and schedules were randomly iteratively generated.

Profiles contain comprehensive personal information about a fictitious person. The information in the profiles is targeted by the adversary. A single prompt was sufficient to generate all the profile's information. All profiles are fictitious and no relation to any real people (living or deceased) is intended.
